**Last Updated**: November 13, 2024

## Overview

TrustPay is an escrow service platform that facilitates secure UPI payments between parties. This policy outlines the cancellation and refund procedures for transactions made through our platform.

## 1. Escrow Transaction Cancellation

### 1.1 Before Payment
- Users can cancel an escrow transaction **before making the UPI payment** without any charges
- Simply close the payment request or let it expire (typically 15 minutes)
- No refund is necessary as no payment has been made

### 1.2 After Payment (Funds in Escrow)
- Once payment is made and funds are held in escrow, cancellation requires **mutual agreement** from both parties (payer and payee)
- If both parties agree to cancel:
  - Full refund will be processed to the payer's UPI account
  - Processing time: 3-5 business days
  - TrustPay service fee (if applicable) is **non-refundable**

### 1.3 Unilateral Cancellation
- If only one party wants to cancel, the other party must agree
- If no agreement is reached, either party can raise a **dispute**
- Disputes are resolved through our dispute resolution process (see Section 3)
